# Pessable Test Project
This is a simple rails application. User can login and signup and can also invites his friends to the application.
- I did not use devise for session handling.
- I used bcrypt to secure password.
## Requirements
- Ruby 2.6.3
- Rails 6.0.3.6
## Database
- Postgres 13.2

- git clone https://github.com/usmanasifzai/pressable.git
- cd pressable
- `bundle install`
- `yarn`
- `rake db:create` `rake db:migrate`
- `rails s`
## If I had extra time
- I can write test cases.
- Improvements in UI/UX.
## Quick start for local development
The application will be running at http://localhost:3000/
